# Logistic_Regression_Project
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.
We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
Here 'Clicked on Ad' is the labelled column.
Exploratory Data Analysis was done.
Prediction and Evaluation were done using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
